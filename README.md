Binary to Emoji: What does 140 characters even mean?
====================================================

Good coders are lazy. Meaning that they do work up front to prevent
needing to do way more work later.  Not bothering to understand how
character encoding works has lead to some of the most difficult, arduous
programming conundrum's I've ever seen.

We'll have fun in this class. We'll learn about:

* How contemplating light switches led to the information revolution
* How font aficionados got their fix before the screen was invented
* How filling a tweet with emojis costs Twitter 4x more than your other
  tweets

You'll come away from the class with very real, helpful skills that will
help you understand and fix ugly problems while the rest of your team
just wants to give up.
